# simple-angular-SPA

This is a homework on AngularJS v1. It inludes a simple SPA using templates, routing and other stuff.

## Serving locally with NodeJS http-server

Install the server: `npm install http-server -g`
Start it and point to the application: `http-server C:\location\to\app`
The application will be available at "http://localhost:8080/". You can specify a different port by passing '-p <port>' option when starting the server.

## TODO:
 - make URLs pretty with $locationProvider
